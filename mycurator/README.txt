== Description ==

= MyCurator will be Closing on 3/31/2025 =

we will be closing down the MyCurator plugin and our cloud server that supports the plugin. Despite our efforts, weâ€™ve seen a shift in how content is being created. With the advent of advanced language models (LLMs), it has become much easier for our customers to generate targeted articles and content on their own, reducing the need for our solution.


As a result, we have decided to discontinue our services effective March 31st, 2025. We will be canceling all paid subscription fees at the end of November but you will be able to use MyCurator until March 31st and we will provide bug fixes and customer service until 3/31/2025.  

We will no longer be taking on new customers.  We will not be adding new features or functionality.


It has been over 12 years since we first published MyCurator and we have enjoyed the journey with our customers.  We appreciate your support and loyalty over this time.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does MyCurator work with most themes? =

MyCurator creates a simple excerpted blog post, with a link to the original page.  It should work with most
themes. Optionally, it will try to save an image from the article as the featured image for the post.

= Does MyCurator work with Network Sites? =

Yes, MyCurator works with Network sites.  You must have a key for each site.  Enterprise options are available 
for businesses and larger sites that need many keys.

= Does MyCurator work with other languages? =

Yes, MyCurator will read and post articles written in other languages.  All characters in the UTF-8 encoding, the same
used by WordPress, will be displayed.  You can customize the link to the original page to match your language.  
The admin pages, documentation and the training videos are only in English at this time.

= How often does MyCurator read my sources for articles? =

You can set MyCurator to process every 3, 6, 12 or 24 hours, depending on how often new articles are posted to 
your sources.  Processing happens in the background, with most of the processing off-site using our
cloud services.
